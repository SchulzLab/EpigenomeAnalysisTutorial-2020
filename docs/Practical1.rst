Practical I - Footprint calling & Transcription factor prediction
==================================================================
In the first practical, we will perform a footprint analysis with `HINT <http://www.regulatory-genomics.org/hint/>`_ to identify cell specific binding sites from open chromatin data (ATAC-seq). 

**The final version of the practical will be available at 19.07.2017 at the latest.**

Step1: Footprint calling
-----------------------------------------------

First, we will use `HINT <http://www.regulatory-genomics.org/hint/>`_ to find genomic regions (footprints) with cell specific TF binding sites. For this, HINT requires (1) a sorted bam file containing the aligned reads from the sequencing library (DNase-,ATAC- or histone ChIP-seq) (2) and a bed file including peaks detected in the same sequencing library provided in (1). These peak regions are used by HINT to reduce the search space and can be generated by any  peak caller. 

Here, we will analyze ATAC-seq data from LSK cells (equivalent to MPP cells), B cells and T CD4 cells obtained from `Lara-Astiaso et al 2014 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60103>`_. We have performed low level analysis steps including read alignment and peaks calling in chromossome 1, which can be found in this folder ``/EpigenomicsTutorial-ISMB2017/session2/step1/input``. Check `here <https://github.com/SchulzLab/EpigenomicsTutorial-ISMB2017/blob/master/session2/step1/input/scripts.sh>`_ for a script showing commands used to generate these files for B cell ATAC-seq experiments.

**1.** First, go to the EpigenomicsTutorial-ISMB2017 directory and generate an output folder for the result files:
::
    cd EpigenomicsTutorial-ISMB2017
    mkdir session2/step1/output
   
**2.** Execute the following commands to call footprints on B, LSK and CD4 cells for chromosome 1:
::
    rgt-hint --atac-footprints --organism=mm10 --output-location=session2/step1/output/ --output-prefix=B_ATAC_chr1_footprints session2/step1/input/B_ATAC_chr1.bam session2/step1/input/B_ATACPeaks_chr1.bed
    rgt-hint --atac-footprints --organism=mm10 --output-location=session2/step1/output/ --output-prefix=LSK_ATAC_chr1_footprints session2/step1/input/LSK_ATAC_chr1.bam session2/step1/input/LSK_ATACPeaks_chr1.bed
    rgt-hint --atac-footprints --organism=mm10 --output-location=session2/step1/output/ --output-prefix=CD4_ATAC_chr1_footprints session2/step1/input/CD4_ATAC_chr1.bam session2/step1/input/CD4_ATACPeaks_chr1.bed

This will generate an output file, i.e  ``session2/step1/output/B_ATAC_chr1_footprints.bed``, containing the genomic locations of the footprints.  HINT also produces a file with ending ".info", which has general statistics from the analysis as no. of footprints, total number of reads and so on. 

We can use `IGV <http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/>`_ to vizualise ATAC-seq signals and footprint predictions in particular loci. First, we can use a special HINT command to generate genomic profiles (bigWig files). 
::
    rgt-hint --print-signal --bc-signal --bigWig --organism=mm10 --reads-file=./session2/step1/input/B_ATAC_chr1.bam --regions-file=./session2/step1/input/B_ATACPeaks_chr1.bed --output-location=./session2/step1/output --output-prefix=B_ATAC_chr1
    rgt-hint --print-signal --bc-signal --bigWig --organism=mm10 --reads-file=./session2/step1/input/CD4_ATAC_chr1.bam --regions-file=./session2/step1/input/CD4_ATACPeaks_chr1.bed --output-location=./session2/step1/output --output-prefix=CD4_ATAC_chr1
    rgt-hint --print-signal --bc-signal --bigWig --organism=mm10 --reads-file=./session2/step1/input/LSK_ATAC_chr1.bam --regions-file=./session2/step1/input/LSK_ATACPeaks_chr1.bed --output-location=./session2/step1/output --output-prefix=LSK_ATAC_chr1

This bigwig file contains number of ATAC-seq (or DNAse-seq) reads at each genomic position as estimated by HINT after signal normalization and cleveage bias correction. This is therefore more accurate than simply looking a coverage profiles of a bam file. 

Open all bigwig and footprint files (bed) generated above in IGV. Remember to set the genome version to mm10 beforehand. You can also enrich the data by opening bam files of histone modifications as H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (provided in session 1). Check for example the genomic profiles around the gene Zp70, which is part of T cell receptor. We observe that this gene has several open chromatin regions and high levels of histone levels in the start of the gene, which are specific to CD4 T cells. There is also some open chromatin level around exon 3, which is supported by H3K4me1 modifications. This potential enhancer region is also present in distinct degrees in B and LSK cells.  

**3.** An important question when doing footprint analysis is to evaluate which TF motifs overlap with footprints and evaluate the ATAC-seq profiles around these motifs. RGT suite also offers a tool for finding motif predicted binding sites (mpbs). For example, we analyze here motifs from factors SPI1 and ELK4, which were discussed in Lara-Astiaso et al. 2014 to be associated respectively associated to LSK and CD4 cells.

Execute the following commands to do motif matching inside footprints for chromosome 1:
::
    rgt-motifanalysis --matching --organism=mm10 --output-location=session2/step1/output/ --use-only-motifs=session2/step1/input/motifs.txt session2/step1/output/B_ATAC_chr1_footprints.bed
    rgt-motifanalysis --matching --organism=mm10 --output-location=session2/step1/output/ --use-only-motifs=session2/step1/input/motifs.txt session2/step1/output/CD4_ATAC_chr1_footprints.bed
    rgt-motifanalysis --matching --organism=mm10 --output-location=session2/step1/output/ --use-only-motifs=session2/step1/input/motifs.txt session2/step1/output/LSK_ATAC_chr1_footprints.bed

The file ``session2/step1/motifs.txt``  contains a list of `JASPAR <http://jaspar.genereg.net/>`_ motif ids to be used in the analysis. Ignoring this option will search for all JASPAR motifs. The above commands will generate bed files (i.e. LSK_ATAC_footprints_mpbs.bed) containing mpbs overlapping with distinct footprint regions. The 4th column contains the motif name and the 5th column the bitscore of the motif match.  If you open these files in IGV, you will observe that a ELK4 binding site near the 3rd exon of the gene Zp70. 


**4.** Finally, we use HINT to generate average ATAC-seq profiles around binding sites of particular TF. This analysis allow us to inspect the chromatin chromatin accessibility and the underlying sequence. Moreover, by comparing the cut profiles from two ATAC-seq libraries (i.s. LSK vs T CD4 cells
), we can get insights on changes in binding in two cells. For this, execute the following commands:
::
    mkdir session2/step1/output/LSK_B
    rgt-hint --diff-footprints --organism=mm10 --mpbs-file=session2/step1/result/LSK_B_ATAC_footprints_mpbs.bed --reads-file1=session2/step1/input/LSK_ATAC.bam --reads-file2=session2/step1/input/B_ATAC.bam --output-location=session2/step1/output/LSK_B --output-prefix=LSK_B

    mkdir session2/step1/output/LSK_CD4
    rgt-hint --diff-footprints --organism=mm10 --mpbs-file=session2/step1/result/LSK_CD4_ATAC_footprints_mpbs.bed --reads-file1=session2/step1/input/LSK_ATAC.bam --reads-file2=session2/step1/input/CD4_ATAC.bam --output-location=session2/step1/output/LSK_CD4 --output-prefix=LSK_CD4

The above commands will generate eps files with a ATAC-seq profile for each of the motifs founds in the provided mpbs bed files. Let's check the profiles in the comparison LSK and CD4, you will see that ELK4 has higher number of ATAC-seq counts in CD4 cells, while SPI1 has more ATAC-seq in LSK cells. Higher ATAC counts indicates higher activity of the factor in that particular cell. This fits with the results discussed in Lara-Astiaso that SPI1 are more relevant/active in LSK, while ELK4 in CD4 cells.
